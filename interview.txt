Why did you leave your last job?

I left my last job because I had reached my full potential in my role. I wanted
to work for a different company that had higher goals and aspirations, that would
put my skills to good use. My employer was fantastic and we achieved many great
goals together while I was there, but the time had come to take my career into
a new direction.
